# Google Clone

Google Search landing page clone.

This is a full (not actually full) and responsive version of Google Search, with some cool features added based on the looks and aesthetics of Google Search site.

It has the Apps List pop-up when you click the app drawer icon, the Notifications pop-up when you click the notification bell icon and the User Account pop-up when you click the account icon. They're all found at the right-top corner of the page.

Additional pop-up is the Settings pop-up, which you can access by clicking the settings link in the footer.

**Note:** This site is only a Front-End version of the site, it doesn't do search and nor redirect to any of the links provided in the actual Google Search site.
